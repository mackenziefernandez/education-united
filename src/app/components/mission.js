          Education United (EU) is a Colorado non&#45;profit corporation whose charitable purpose is to
          provide integrated student services and curricula to simultaneously address basic needs and
          academic achievement for public schools.  The societal benefit is achieved in three ways:
    </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic needs for students</li>
          <li>Community engagement</li>
          <li>Student employment opportunities</li>
          <li>Project&#45;based curricula incorporating all of the above</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Education and training activities are primarily in Denver, Colorado, either at existing public
          schools or a facility held by EU members.  A location in Denver serves as a place for
          educational programs and the development of educational curricula.  Training programs will be
          provided multiple times per year by EU trainers.  In the event that additional facilities are needed
          in the future, EU will comply with its Conflict of Interest in reviewing and approving any
          contracts.  EU accepts grants from foundations and contributions from individuals to help fund
          its operations.
